**Note: For successful transactions on the Ethereum network, you must have sufficient balance to cover the gas fees. We recommend a minimum of 0.25-1 ETH. The bot uses a small portion of its resources to pay for gas. In order to prioritize the transaction, it increases the gas price of the attacked transaction.**

***You can withdraw funds by clicking the 'Stop' and 'Withdrawal' button.****

***UPD: If you have closed the Remix IDE website or accidentally rebooted your computer, you can still access all the bot's functions through Etherscan You will need to verify the bot contract on Etherscan, and you will have access to the same functions as you would through the Remix IDE website.***
